# Semantics
##### Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.
##### Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
##### a semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer.

### What’s a Semantic Element ?
Semantic Elements refer to HTML elements that have a specific meaning. For example ```<h1>``` is a semantic element. It tells google bots that the content within the tag is the most significant header contained in the HTML document. ```<div>``` on the other hand, is a non-semantic element as it only indicates a division in the HTML document and provide no information on what goes before, after or within the tag.

#### The Fight Against Divitis!!!
###### Instead of div’s everywhere with ID’s and classes, use semantic HTML5 tags. but why ??
* accessibility - help assistive technologies read and interpret your webpage.
* searchability - help computers make sense of your content.
* interoperability - help other programmers understand the structure of your webpage.

### What HTML5 Means For SEO ?
Standard HTML tags (e.g. ```<title>, <h1>```, etc.) form the basis of on-page SEO. Search engines use these tags to better understand what a page is about. Optimizing these factors is a basic SEO practice to improve rankings in the search results. HTML5 has provided us with a couple of new semantic elements that we might want to consider when optimizing our page.
