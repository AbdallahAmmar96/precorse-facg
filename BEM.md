# BEM

### Block, Element and Modifier

**Block** Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.

```
header, container, menu, input
```

**Element** A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.

```
menu item, list item, header title
```

**Modifier** A flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior.

```
disabled, highlighted, fixed, size big, color yellow
```
